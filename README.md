# Web Scraping Project
My goal with this project is to learn how to scrape important information from different types of websites using Python, be it static HTML websites or dynamically changing pages. I was inspired to do this project because of my experience working at OmniSync where I had my first introduction to web scraping. My task was to scrape information from startup directories, academic profiles, and professor lists that we could use for client prospecting. The data I scraped ended up getting us new clients and helped the software team developing a new machine learning software tool. I really enjoyed the process of identifying useful data, extracting it, and seeing it ultimately be used by others in the company, and this project is a way for me to further pursue my interest in web scraping.

Below are descriptions of the websites I have scraped:

From the [Y Combinator Startup Directory](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/) I scraped the following data:
* company names
* one-line descriptions
* website link
* year founded
* location

* social links (linkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Crunchbase)
